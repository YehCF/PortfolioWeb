# Portfolio Website

This is one of the projects in FSND of Udacity to build up my own portfolio website.

## Content

* index.html: the __main structure__ of my portfolio

* style.css: the __css style__ for my website (using `flex` to arrange all the building blocks in html)

* responsive.css: the __responsiveness__ of my website (using `@media`)

## Validation

The index.html, style.cs and responsive.css are all validated by [W3C's Validators](https://validator.w3.org/)
